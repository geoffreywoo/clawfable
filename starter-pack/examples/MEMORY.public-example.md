# MEMORY.md — Public Example (Production-Style)

> This is a public, realistic example of a high-utility MEMORY.md used for OpenClaw operator workflows.

## Operator profile
- Execution-first, concise reporting, evidence over claims.
- Prefers defaults and forward motion over open-ended option sets.
- Values reliability loops over one-off heroics.

## Mission
Build and operate practical agent systems that create measurable outcomes (time saved, throughput gained, revenue opportunities).

## Canonical architecture
identity → memory → execution → verification → evolution

## Durable rules
1. **Truth-in-execution:** never mark complete without artifact + verification.
2. **Risk gating:** medium/high-risk actions require impact + rollback + test plan.
3. **No drift:** repeated failure classes must become explicit rules/runbook steps.
4. **Clarity over volume:** short status with proof beats long narratives.

## Quality bar
A “publish-grade” page must include:
- who it is for
- expected end-state
- concrete implementation steps
- failure modes and fixes
- actionable next links

## Known anti-patterns
- shipping tiny frequent edits that don’t improve utility
- generic AI prose without examples
- claiming done without tests/build checks
- over-redacting operational logic

## Incidents and lessons
- 2026-02-27: 1-minute content loop produced shallow output.
  - Root cause: optimized cadence over depth.
  - Fix: flagship deep pages + stronger quality rubric.
  - Prevention: no publish without concrete examples and copy-paste blocks.

- 2026-02-27: architecture page was still too abstract.
  - Root cause: insufficient direct templates.
  - Fix: add copy-paste starter pack and raw links.
  - Prevention: every architecture page includes runnable artifacts.

## Content strategy memory
- Architecture is a primary pillar (not secondary).
- Anti Hunter learnings should be framed as transferable operator patterns.
- Default publishing style: practical, tutorial-first, evidence-backed.

## Operating checklist
- Before writing: define outcome + reader + utility.
- Before shipping: build/test pass and link integrity check.
- After shipping: capture lesson if anything failed.

## Next planned upgrades
- Expand architecture case studies with side-by-side “bad vs good” implementations.
- Add skill-composition tutorials with copy-paste flows.
- Build curriculum pathways (beginner → operator → advanced architecture).

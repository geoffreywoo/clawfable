# Gemini Icon Concepts

- 1. **The Scholar's Claw** — `001-the-scholar-s-claw.svg`
  - This minimalist design fuses the lobster claw and open bible into a single, cohesive symbol. The two halves represent the open pages of a book, while their combined outer shape forms the distinct silhouette of a lobster claw. The central void implies the book's spine, reinforcing the dual motif in a clean, abstract form.
- 2. **The Sacred Grip** — `002-the-sacred-grip.svg`
  - This concept emphasizes the claw, using negative space to reveal the open bible. The powerful outer pincer shapes create a dynamic sense of grasping, while the void between them clearly defines the silhouette of a book, complete with a central spine. It creates a clever visual discovery for the viewer.
- 3. **The Covenant Claw** — `003-the-covenant-claw.svg`
  - A symmetrical and elegant design where the pages of an open book curve upward to form the pincers of a claw. The hinge of the claw is also the spine of the book, rooted at the bottom of the symbol. This creates a balanced fusion that feels both organic and structured.
- 4. **The Gnostic Pincer** — `004-the-gnostic-pincer.svg`
  - This is a highly abstract and geometric interpretation. A solid rectangular shape, representing a book or pillar of knowledge, is fused with a semi-circular pincer. The design plays on the contrast between straight and curved lines to represent the two core ideas in their most elemental forms.
- 5. **The Fused Testament** — `005-the-fused-testament.svg`
  - In this design, an open book serves as the foundation, with the top corners of the pages stylized to curve outwards like the sharp tips of a claw. It prioritizes the 'bible' motif but integrates the 'claw' in a subtle, aggressive flourish, suggesting knowledge with a sharp edge.
- 6. **The Scholar's Pillar** — `006-the-scholar-s-pillar.svg`
  - A strong, stable, and symbolic concept. A central pillar represents the spine of the bible and the foundation of knowledge. Emerging from its sides are two abstract pincers, symbolizing the act of grasping or comprehending that knowledge. The mark is architectural, balanced, and authoritative.

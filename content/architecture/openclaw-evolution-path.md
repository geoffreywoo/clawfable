# OpenClaw Evolution Path: From Helper to Operator

## Why evolution matters
Most agent setups stall because they optimize prompts instead of systems.

Real progress comes from moving through clear maturity stages.

## Stage 0 — Assistant mode
- one-off Q&A
- no durable memory
- no execution accountability

**Constraint:** useful for ideation, weak for operations.

## Stage 1 — Operator baseline
- identity files (`SOUL.md`, `USER.md`)
- daily + long-term memory
- controlled tool usage
- explicit reporting

**Goal:** reliable daily task execution.

## Stage 2 — Workflow operator
- recurring playbooks
- domain-specific templates
- tighter guardrails for external actions
- handoff-ready outputs

**Goal:** repeatable business workflows.

## Stage 3 — Multi-agent system
- parallel sub-agents for research/build tasks
- orchestration and arbitration patterns
- queueing and scheduling discipline

**Goal:** throughput without quality collapse.

## Stage 4 — Production reliability
- incident logging and runbooks
- recovery ladders
- verification-before-done enforcement
- architecture reviews on failures

**Goal:** compounding reliability, not random heroics.

## Stage transition checklist
Move up only when current stage is stable:
- success criteria met for 2+ weeks
- failure modes documented
- rollback strategy defined

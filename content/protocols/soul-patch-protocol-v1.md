# SOUL Patch Protocol v1

## Goal
Patch an agent's identity layer so execution quality is stable.

## Copy-paste source
- <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geoffreywoo/clawfable/main/starter-pack/core/SOUL.md>

## Apply steps
1. Replace or merge local `SOUL.md` with canonical SOUL baseline.
2. Keep role-specific lines, preserve core truth-in-execution rules.
3. Commit changes with message: `chore: apply soul patch v1`.

## Validation
- agent no longer uses canned filler language
- outputs include direct recommendation + verification discipline

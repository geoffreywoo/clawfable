# When OpenClaw Is the Wrong Choice

## Use another tool if:
1. You only need simple deterministic automations.
2. You have zero appetite for operational maintenance.
3. You need strict no-LLM execution paths for every workflow.

## Better alternatives in these cases
- Pure workflow automation tools
- Narrow single-purpose bots
- Traditional scripts with cron and fixed logic

## Why this matters
Choosing the wrong stack creates complexity tax and slower execution.

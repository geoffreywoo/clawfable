# OpenClaw vs n8n: Which One Should You Use?

## TL;DR
- Use **OpenClaw** when judgment + agentic execution matter.

- Use both when you want orchestration + reasoning.

## Decision matrix
- Complex decisions: OpenClaw
- Fixed data pipeline: n8n
- Human-like operator loop: OpenClaw
- Large connector ecosystem with simple logic: n8n

## Best hybrid model

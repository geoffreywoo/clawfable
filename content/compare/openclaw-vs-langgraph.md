# OpenClaw vs LangGraph

## Core difference
- **OpenClaw**: operator runtime and execution framework.
- **LangGraph**: framework for building graph-based agent systems.

## Choose OpenClaw if
- You need production-ready operations quickly.
- You want channel/tool integration out of the box.

## Choose LangGraph if
- You’re building custom agent graphs deeply in code.
- You need low-level state machine control.

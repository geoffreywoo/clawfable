# Week 2 Failure Postmortem

## Incident
Early scope drift toward monetization plumbing before content depth was ready.

## Impact
Delayed publication cadence and diluted quality focus.

## Root cause
We optimized for future tracking before proving the core content engine.

## Fix
- Re-prioritized to architecture + content production.
- Added content-quality gate before any monetization expansion.

## Prevention rule
No new funnel complexity until target page velocity and quality bar are met.

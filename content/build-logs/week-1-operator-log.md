# Week 1 Operator Log

## Shipped
- Core website architecture
- Section strategy
- Initial keyword backlog
- First 10 foundational pages

## What worked
- Clear hub structure made content planning faster.
- Strong page template reduced draft variance.

## What broke
- Overly broad early scope (affiliate/tracking too early).

## Change for next week
- Focus on page quality and publish cadence first.
- Add product pages only after guide cluster is stable.

# Start Here: Build Your First Real OpenClaw System

This is the fastest sequence to go from zero to useful.

## Recommended order (don’t skip)
1. Complete **Track A** first (environment + sanity checks).
2. Pick exactly one of **Track B** or **Track C** based on your immediate use case.
3. End with **Decide your stack** so your architecture choices stay deliberate.

## Track A — New operator (90 minutes)
1. [OpenClaw Setup Guide (2026)](/guides/openclaw-setup-guide-2026)
2. [Install OpenClaw on Mac](/guides/install-openclaw-mac) or [Ubuntu VPS](/guides/install-openclaw-ubuntu-vps)
3. [OpenClaw Troubleshooting Handbook](/guides/openclaw-troubleshooting-handbook)
4. [OpenClaw Configuration Deep Dive](/guides/openclaw-configuration-deep-dive) *(only if you need custom runtime behavior)*

## Track B — Founder automation (half day)
1. [OpenClaw for Founder Ops](/playbooks/openclaw-for-founder-ops)
2. [OpenClaw Daily Brief Automation](/guides/openclaw-daily-brief-automation)
3. [Founder Ops Template Pack](/templates/founder-ops-template-pack)

## Track C — Growth/ops workflows (half day)

2. [OpenClaw for Support Automation](/playbooks/openclaw-for-support-automation)
3. [Operator Bundle](/templates/operator-bundle)

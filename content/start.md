# Start Here: Build Your First Real OpenClaw System

This is the fastest sequence to go from zero to useful.

## Pick your path first (30 seconds)
- **I’m new and want a stable base:** Start with **Track A**, then choose one of **Track B** or **Track C**.
- **I need architecture clarity first:** Do **Track D**, then return to **Track A** for implementation.
- **I’m evaluating tools, not committing yet:** Jump to **Decide your stack** and read one comparison before touching setup.

## Recommended order (don’t skip)
1. Complete **Track A** first (environment + sanity checks).
2. Pick exactly one of **Track B** or **Track C** based on your immediate use case.
3. End with **Decide your stack** so your architecture choices stay deliberate.

## Quick jump by intent
- **I need install + first successful run:** [Track A — New operator](#track-a--new-operator-90-minutes)
- **I need founder execution workflows:** [Track B — Founder automation](#track-b--founder-automation-half-day)
- **I need growth/support operations:** [Track C — Growth/ops workflows](#track-c--growthops-workflows-half-day)
- **I need architecture context before building:** [Track D — Architecture mental model](#track-d--architecture-mental-model-45-minutes)

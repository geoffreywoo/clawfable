# OpenClaw for Agencies: Client Ops Playbook

## Outcome
Standardize client delivery and reduce operational chaos.

## Core structure
- Client onboarding automation
- Weekly performance reporting
- Task routing and SLA tracking
- Escalation management

## Implementation steps
1. Define onboarding checklist per client tier.
2. Build recurring report templates.
3. Set SLA categories and routing rules.
4. Add weekly quality review with exceptions log.

## Failure modes and fixes
- Scope creep → enforce intake form + change-order triggers.
- Reporting inconsistency → standardized metrics schema.
- Missed deadlines → SLA alerts + escalation ladder.

## Artifact
Agency operations SOP + client reporting template.

## Next step
- `/templates/agency-ops-pack`
- `/build-logs/week-3-operator-log`

# OpenClaw for E-commerce Automation

## Outcome
Automate merchandising, customer messaging, and conversion ops.

## Core workflows
- Product update sync
- Promotional campaign ops
- Abandoned cart follow-ups
- Support ticket triage

## Implementation steps
1. Define event triggers (new product, low stock, cart abandonment).
2. Create approved response/promo templates.
3. Add profitability guardrails for discounts.
4. Monitor conversion and refund metrics weekly.

## Failure modes and fixes
- Over-discounting → enforce minimum margin checks.
- Mixed brand tone → centralize message templates.
- Slow response times → prioritize high-LTV customer segments.

## Artifact
E-commerce automation map + campaign checklist.

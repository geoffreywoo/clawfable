# OpenClaw for Newsletter Automation

## Outcome
Ship high-quality newsletters consistently with clear editorial standards and measurable growth.

## Who this is for
Operators/founders publishing weekly insights who need speed without quality decay.

## System architecture
- Intake: sources, ideas, trend signals
- Drafting: structure + thesis + evidence
- Editing: quality and voice checks
- Distribution: send workflow and post-send analysis

## Implementation steps
1. Define newsletter ICP and content thesis.
2. Set source intake rules (primary sources first).
3. Build drafting template with required sections.
4. Apply editorial QA gate before sending.
5. Generate post-send report (open/click/reply signals).

## Draft template (example)
- lead insight
- why it matters
- practical implication
- action for reader

## Failure modes and fixes
- generic output → force source-backed concrete claims.
- weak open rates → rewrite subject strategy by segment.
- low click depth → simplify structure and strengthen CTA.

## KPI suggestions
- open rate by segment
- CTR by section
- reply rate and qualitative feedback themes

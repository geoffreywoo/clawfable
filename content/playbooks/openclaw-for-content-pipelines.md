# OpenClaw for Content Pipelines

## Outcome
Turn one strong idea into a multi-channel publishing pipeline with quality gates.

## Who this is for
Teams publishing 3-10 pieces/week who need consistent output without quality collapse.

## Pipeline architecture
Research → angle selection → draft → edit → distribution → review.

## Implementation steps
1. Define content thesis and audience.
2. Build a source intake list (primary sources only).
3. Create draft checklist (clarity, novelty, utility).
4. Add editorial gate before publish.
5. Run weekly review on winners/losers.

## Editorial QA checklist
- clear claim in first 3 lines
- at least one concrete example
- no generic LLM filler
- explicit CTA/next step

## Failure modes and fixes
- bland output → force contrarian or differentiated angle selection.
- inconsistent cadence → fixed publishing windows and preloaded queue.
- weak conversion → tighter hooks and stronger action-oriented endings.

## KPI suggestions
- publish consistency (weekly)
- CTR from content to target pages
- % content pieces driving meaningful actions

# Anti Hunter Learning Loop Lessons v1

## Transferable lessons
1. Prompt quality is not enough; architecture wins long-term.
2. Memory split (daily vs curated) prevents repeated mistakes.
3. Verification-before-done is the core trust primitive.
4. Recurring failures must become rules, not just notes.

## Practical implication
Agent performance compounds only when failures are systematically turned into protocol updates.

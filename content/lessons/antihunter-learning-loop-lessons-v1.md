# Anti Hunter Learning Loop Lessons v1

## Goal
Turn Anti Hunter operating lessons into reusable doctrine for OpenClaw agents.

## Anti Hunter Instantiation
### Context
Rapid output growth exposed recurring failures: style drift, memory entropy, and loop stalls.

### Mechanism
Tie three layers together as one system:
1. SOUL constraints shape output behavior.
2. MEMORY promotion turns incidents into durable rules.
3. Loop protocols enforce verification gates and anti-stall execution.

### Result
Compounding reliability: fewer repeated failure classes and tighter claim-to-proof alignment.

### Transferability
This architecture generalizes to any agent that needs long-run consistency, not just higher short-run output volume.

## Copy-paste runnable block
```bash
# quick doctrine linkage audit (SOUL <-> MEMORY <-> loops)
rg -n "Doctrine links|Validation checklist|Copy-paste runnable block" content/protocols content/lessons

# run site build gate
npm run build
```

## Validation checklist
- [ ] Each doctrine page includes Anti Hunter instantiation (context/mechanism/result/transferability)
- [ ] Each doctrine page includes a runnable copy-paste block
- [ ] Each doctrine page includes a validation checklist
- [ ] SOUL, MEMORY, and loop pages are cross-linked

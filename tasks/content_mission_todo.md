# Clawfable Core Content Mission — Task List v2 (Doctrine Focus)

## Objective
Make Clawfable the best agent-first doctrine resource for OpenClaw around:
1) SOUL design,
2) MEMORY architecture,
3) self-learning loops,
using concrete Anti Hunter instantiation examples.

> Daily packets are explicitly out-of-scope for this phase and handled later.

## Phase A — Canonical Doctrine Structure (P0)
- [ ] A1. Reframe site IA copy around doctrine pillars: SOUL / MEMORY / Learning Loops.
- [ ] A2. Add clear “Core Doctrine Route” blocks on home + `/start`.
- [ ] A3. Ensure each doctrine section has: purpose, copy-paste assets, anti-patterns, and validation checks.

## Phase B — SOUL Pillar (P0)
- [x] B1. Publish SOUL deep-dive v1: from philosophy to enforceable rules.
- [x] B2. Include direct Anti Hunter examples of strong vs weak SOUL constraints.
- [x] B3. Add copy-paste SOUL starter + migration checklist for existing agents.
- [x] B4. Add SOUL validation tests (voice drift, done-claim discipline, escalation behavior).

## Phase C — MEMORY Pillar (P0)
- [ ] C1. Publish MEMORY architecture v1: daily logs vs curated memory vs structured memory.
- [ ] C2. Include Anti Hunter examples of memory promotions (incident -> durable rule).
- [ ] C3. Add copy-paste MEMORY starter pack (core + full public example).
- [ ] C4. Add memory hygiene protocol (what to store, what not to store, promotion cadence).

## Phase D — Self-Learning Loops Pillar (P0)
- [x] D1. Publish loop architecture v1: plan -> execute -> verify -> incident -> rule update.
- [x] D2. Add Anti Hunter case examples of loop failures and architectural fixes.
- [x] D3. Add copy-paste incident schema + prevention-rule protocol.
- [x] D4. Add loop benchmark checks (repeat-failure rate, verification compliance).

## Phase E — Anti Hunter Instantiation Layer (P1)
- [ ] E1. Build “Anti Hunter Examples” sections into every doctrine page.
- [ ] E2. For each example: context, mechanism, result, transferability.
- [ ] E3. Add redaction rule: default full operational logic, redact only secrets/private identifiers.

## Phase F — Skill/Onboarding Alignment (P1)
- [ ] F1. Update `skill.md` to emphasize doctrine flow over feed flow.
- [ ] F2. Add “first 60 minutes doctrine setup” tutorial for new OpenClaw agents.
- [ ] F3. Ensure skill files point to SOUL/MEMORY/loop core pages first.

## Phase G — Quality Gates (P0)
- [ ] G1. Publish-grade checklist for doctrine pages.
- [ ] G2. Require concrete Anti Hunter example per major section.
- [ ] G3. Require copy-paste runnable block per page.
- [ ] G4. Require validation/test checklist per page.

## Automation Loop Design (after this task list is approved)
- [ ] L1. Create atomic doctrine task queue (`tasks/queue.jsonl`).
- [ ] L2. Worker loop: pick one doctrine task -> implement -> build check -> commit -> mark done.
- [ ] L3. Add lock + timeout + retry + blocker escalation.
- [ ] L4. Emit concise progress updates every N completed tasks.

## Definition of Done (this phase)
- [ ] SOUL pillar publish-grade
- [ ] MEMORY pillar publish-grade
- [ ] self-learning loops pillar publish-grade
- [ ] each pillar includes concrete Anti Hunter examples + copy-paste assets + validation checks
- [ ] skill/onboarding points to doctrine-first flow

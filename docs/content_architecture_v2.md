# Clawfable Content Architecture v2

## Purpose
Create a coherent publishing system that makes Clawfable understandable, useful, and monetizable.

## Primary content pillars

### Pillar A — Foundation (Understanding + Setup)
- OpenClaw setup guide
- install guides by environment
- configuration and safety baseline
- troubleshooting and incident recovery

### Pillar B — Implementation (Use Cases)
- founder ops
- content ops
- lead gen
- support automation
- community ops
- agency client ops

### Pillar C — Evaluation (Decision Intent)
- OpenClaw vs n8n
- OpenClaw vs LangGraph
- OpenClaw vs DIY stacks
- when OpenClaw is the wrong choice

### Pillar D — Proof (Trust + Authority)
- weekly build logs
- failure postmortems
- benchmark snapshots

### Pillar E — Assets (Execution Accelerators)
- launch checklists
- template packs
- skills packs
- bundles

## Site structure map
- /
- /start
- /guides
- /playbooks
- /compare
- /templates
- /skills
- /build-logs
- /about

## Page intent mapping
- Guides: informational + implementation
- Playbooks: implementation + product bridge
- Compare: commercial investigation
- Templates/Skills: transactional
- Build Logs: trust reinforcement

## Internal linking rules (required)
Each page must include links to:
1) its hub page
2) one adjacent page in same pillar
3) one related page in another pillar
4) one execution asset page
5) /start for new users (except /start itself)

## Content maturity levels
- Level 1: scaffold draft
- Level 2: operational guide (commands/checklists)
- Level 3: publish-grade (proof, links, CTA)

Goal for next sprint: elevate top 12 pages to Level 3.

## Publishing order (next 14 days)
1. /start
2. top 5 foundation pages
3. top 5 implementation pages
4. top 3 comparison pages
5. 2 proof/build-log pages

## Canonical CTA strategy (soft for now)
- primary: "Start here"
- secondary: "Use this template"
- tertiary: "Read the next implementation step"

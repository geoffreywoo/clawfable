# Clawfable Phase 1 Execution Plan (First Principles)

## Goal
Build an SEO-driven trust-to-transaction system around OpenClaw implementation content that converts into:
1) affiliate revenue,
2) template/skill sales,
3) implementation upsells.

## North-Star Metrics (first 60 days)
- 30 published pages
- 5 pages ranking top 20 for target terms
- 3%+ page-to-email conversion on money pages
- 1.5%+ click-through to product pages
- First $1k blended revenue (affiliate + product)

## Business Model
Each page must map to one of 3 intents:
- Setup intent
- Comparison intent
- Money intent

Every page includes 3 monetization levers:
- Relevant affiliate links
- Owned product CTA (template/skill)
- Email capture CTA

## Content System
- L1: Pillars (evergreen)
- L2: Programmatic use-case pages
- L3: Proof posts (real runs, wins/failures)
- L4: Product pages

Hard rule: each post must include an original artifact (config, script, benchmark, template, troubleshooting matrix).

## Initial Funnel
- Free: OpenClaw Launch Checklist
- Paid: Templates/skills ($29-$99)
- Bundle: Operator Pack ($199-$499)
- Service: Implementation sprint ($1k+)

## Publishing Rhythm (30 days)
- Week 1: 5 pillar pages + analytics + lead magnet
- Week 2: 10 programmatic pages + 3 paid products
- Week 3: 10 pages + 2 proof case studies + CTR optimization
- Week 4: 5 high-intent money pages + first bundle launch

## Quality Bar
Do not publish if:
- no clear keyword intent
- no monetization path
- no original artifact
- no internal links
- no specific CTA

## Page Template (required)
1. Problem and audience
2. Exact setup steps
3. Failure modes + fixes
4. Recommended stack (affiliate)
5. Download template/skill CTA
6. Done-for-you setup CTA

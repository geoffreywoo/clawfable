# Clawfable Operating Loop (Autonomous Mode)

## Mission
Build a complete content site for clawfable.com that teaches OpenClaw implementation from real operator experience.

## Working agreement
- Agent executes continuously without waiting for approval on low-risk content/architecture work.
- Agent interrupts only for:
  1) blockers (access/auth/deployment constraints),
  2) high-risk irreversible actions,
  3) major strategy forks requiring preference.

## Build loop
1. Plan next content batch (10-20 pages target map).
2. Write/upgrade pages to publish-grade quality.
3. Verify links/routes/build.
4. Push to main.
5. Report concise changelog + next batch.

## Quality bar for each page
- explicit audience and outcome
- prerequisites
- implementation steps
- failure modes + fixes
- linked next actions

## Current phase
Phase 1: content depth and architecture completion.
Phase 2: monetization layers (templates/skills) after content foundation is solid.

# Clawfable Service Narrative v1

## What Clawfable is
Clawfable is an operator-focused knowledge and implementation service for OpenClaw.

It helps builders go from:
- "I heard about agent workflows" →
- "I have production OpenClaw systems creating real business outcomes."

## Core promise
**Deploy practical OpenClaw systems that save time, increase output, and create revenue.**

No demos. No generic AI fluff. Real setup guides, operating playbooks, and reusable assets.

## Who it serves
1. **Founders**: need leverage across inbox, planning, execution, and comms.
2. **Operators**: need repeatable workflows and fewer manual loops.
3. **Small teams/agencies**: need automation without building a full custom agent stack.

## Product layers
1. **Guides** (teach): installation, configuration, troubleshooting, architecture.
2. **Playbooks** (apply): use-case-specific implementation paths.
3. **Templates/Skills** (execute): copyable assets and packaged capabilities.
4. **Build Logs** (prove): transparent receipts on what was shipped and learned.

## Positioning statement
Clawfable is the practical OpenClaw operating system for builders who care about outcomes, not AI theater.

## What makes Clawfable different
- Evidence-first publishing (commands, artifacts, failure modes)
- Ops-native perspective (execution > novelty)
- Clear implementation pathways (start → deploy → optimize)

## Content-to-service flow
1. Discover via search (guide/comparison)
2. Build confidence via playbooks and proof logs
3. Execute using templates/skills
4. Upgrade into implementation support (later stage)

## Editorial standards
Every high-value page should include:
- exact audience and expected outcome
- prerequisites and constraints
- step-by-step implementation
- failure modes + fixes
- explicit next action

## Anti-goals
- Not a generic AI news site
- Not a trend aggregation blog
- Not a prompt dump with no operating context

## One-line homepage framing
**OpenClaw guides, playbooks, and templates for operators building real systems.**
